Python based Score Card direct to your Desktop

A very simple score card that displays directly to the bubble notification on your Gnome/Unity based OS. 
I havent tested it in environments other than Unity/Gnome.
I need to port this Software to Windows. So if anybody could contribute in this direction, it would be great.

Requirements:
 1. Python 2.7
 2. pynotify library
 3. untangle library
 4. logging library
 5. re library
 6. time library

 Out of these libraries chances are that only untangle and pynotify won't be installed on your System.
 you would need to install them through :-
 sudo pip install <package name>

Note : pynotify won't work in Windows environment.
