# Score-Seeker
Python based Score Card direct to your Desktop

A very simple score card that displays directly to the bubble notification on your Gnome. 
I havent tested it in environments other than Ubuntu Gnome.
I need to port this Software to Windows. So if anybody could contribute in this direction, it would be great.

Requirements:
 1. Python 2.7
 2. urllib library
 3. pynotify library
 4. untangle library

Note : pynotify won't work in Windows environment.
